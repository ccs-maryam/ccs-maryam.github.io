			<img src="Documents_Folder/Io.jpeg" alt="A moon with varying spots of yellow." height="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;"/>
			<p>Io specializes in computer science and has undertaken many projects in various areas, such as web development, data science, and programming. His skills in technology are paired with his much older interest in political science, which stems from his life-long advocation for justice under certain political issues. Although Io is drawn to technical work that is related to civil matters, he can dedicate the same amount of effort into general enterprises and endeavors. Beside his career in computer science Io is also aspiring to become a public official that speaks for the people.</p>

     			<h2>EUROPA</h2>
			<img src="Documents_Folder/Europa.png" alt="A grey moon with dull orange scars." height="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;"/>
			<p>The structural arts is a field that Europa has dedicated himself to for much of his life. Even though he can appreciate modern forms of edifices, Europa laments the unique architecture of ancient cultures from the past which have been forsaken in todayâ€™s process for construction. As a result, Europa pushes for designs that include distinctive attributes unlike the simple blocks that mark human civilization today. With his accredited degree in architecture and 7 years of experience in the work force, Europa hopes to change architecture into the passionate art it once was.</p>

Callisto is currently on the look-out for opportunities where she can contribute her artistry to, such as films, shows, games, and collaboration with other artists.</p>
