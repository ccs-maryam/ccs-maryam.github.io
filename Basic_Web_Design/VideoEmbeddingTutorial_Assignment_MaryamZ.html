		<h1>How to Embed a Service-Hosted Video into a Website</h1>
		<p>Hello! On this page I will give you a step-by-step tutorial on how to embed a video into a website.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Step 1: Locating a Video</h2>
		<p>The first step to embedding a video is to choose a video, and choose which video service to choose it from. Videos from websites like Youtube and Vimeo will generally work, and these services use a method called <b>&lt;iframe&gt;</b>, which will be touched upon later on. When you decide on a video, navigate to its pageâ€”where you watch the video itself. For this tutorial, I will use a video of a looped song that is on Youtube.</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Click on "Share"</h2>
		<p>The video's page should have a "Share" button, which can be found below the video on Youtube. Click on it to display a set of options of sharing the video.</p>

		<h2>Step 3: Click on "Embed"</h2>
		<p>Once you click on "Share," one of the options that will be displayed is "Embed." Click on it so that the site generates the code needed for embedding the video.</p>

		<h2>Step 4: Copy and Paste</h2>
		<p>Copy the code by clicking the "Copy" button or highlighting the text, double-clicking, and clicking the "Copy" option your computer displays. Paste the code into the html of the website you want to embed the video in.</p>

		<p>Once you have completed the previous steps, the video should appear on your website wherever you placed the code for it in the &lt;body&gt; tag. Below you will find the video I embedded myself in this tutorial.</p>
