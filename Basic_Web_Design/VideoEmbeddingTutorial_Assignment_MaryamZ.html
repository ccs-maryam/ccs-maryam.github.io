		<h1>How to Embed a Service-Hosted Video into a Website</h1>
		<p>Hello! On this page I will give you a step-by-step tutorial on how to embed a svideo into a website.</p>
		<h2>Step 1: Locating a Video</h2>
		<p>The first step to embedding a video is to choose a video, and choose which video service to choose it from. Videos from websites like Youtube and Vimeo will generally work, and these services use a method called <b> <iframe> </b>, which will be touched upon later on. When you decide on a video, navigate to its pageâ€”where you watch the video itself. For this tutorial, I will use a video of a looped song that is on Youtube.</p>

		<h2>Step 2: Click on "Share"</h2>
		<p>The video's page should have a "Share" button, which can be found below the video on Youtube. Click on it to find a set of options to share the video.</p>
