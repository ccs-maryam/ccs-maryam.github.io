		<h1>Mega-Makers Class Offered at the Whittier Central Library</h1>
		<p>The Whittier Central Library has recently begun to offer a <b>Mega-Makers</b> class, a monthly class that focuses on teaching teens and adults how to design basic 3D objects in a free online program called <b>Tinkercad</b>. The class is held in a specially designated room called the <b>Maker Space</b> which can be found on the second floor of the library. Those who attend the class can request to have a design they make to be printed by one of the 3D printers the library has, and an additional request can be made per each class that a person attends.

		<h2>Community Impact</h2> 
		<p>The Mega-Makers class is one of the many ways the Whittier Central Library is striving to engage with the community. Like other classes the library has started to offer, such as its <b>Intro to Sewing Machines</b> class, the Mega-Makers class allows Whittier residents to engage in an activity alongside other members of their community, all while exploring an interesting field of design. <q>When I attended the class, I found it pretty simple, but I really liked how the library was trying to teach something that deals with technologyâ€”for free. I think that if enough people show interest in things like this, the Whittier Central Library might look into setting up classes that are more in-depth in their subject matter,</q> says Maryam Zorba, a student that has attended Mega-Makers once.</p>

		<h2>Additional Information</h2>
		<p>The date for the next Mega-Makers class is September 18th, Monday, at 6:00 PM, and the next Intro to Sewing Machines Class will be on September 25th at 5:30 PM. If you are interested in signing up for a class, you may call the library at 562-567-9900 or sign up in-person at the library's reference desk. All the materials required will be provided for in the class. Please remember that both classes are for teens and adults <strong>only</strong>.</p>
