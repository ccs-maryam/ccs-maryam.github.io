		<p>Welcome to My News Hub! This website is dedicated to all things news-worthy. Here, you can access all the news articles I have written. As of now, I only have one article you can find. It is about the Whittier Central Library and the 3D Design class it has started to offer. Important information, such as where the class is, when the class is, and WHY the class is, is also provided! <a href="NewsAssignment_MaryamZ.html" target="_self">Check it out!</a>
