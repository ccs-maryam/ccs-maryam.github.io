		<p>Welcome to My News Hub! This website is dedicated to all things news-worthy. Here, you can access all the news articles I have written. As of now, I only have one article you can find. It is about the Whittier Central Library and the 3D Design class it has recently started offering, along with its next date.<a href="NewsAssignment_MaryamZ.html" target="_self">Check it out!</a>
